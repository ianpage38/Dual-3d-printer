# Summary

- B2D stands for "Belted Dual Drive". It's a bowden style extruder that has extra grip to filament and is hardly audible during retraction. 
- Preview the 3D model on Sketchfab: https://sketchfab.com/models/8568dba4796e4a238a1051e965c39b2c

FEATURES:
- Dual drive gear for improved grip, and prevent grinding filament. Frequent retraction is more reliable
- Belt driven motion don't generate any noise itself during retraction. The only noise left from extruder would come from the stepper motor vibrating the frame of printer
- 3:1 gear ratio to increase torque
- Very durable. No wear on belt and pulley over time comparing to printed gears
- Adjustable compression of a strong spring
- Modular parts for different combination of drive gear, filament and bowden tube
- The bowden connector can slide for 3.5mm. Any diameter of drive gear between 7-12mm is applicable
- Quick changeable drive gears. Can use large gear with slower motor speed for silent operation, and small gears with more torque for super fast extrusion rate. 
- Operation video recording at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjQ7FrQe8s4
- Drive force test with E3D Hobb-Goblin gears, max of 9-10kg (max spring compression. NEMA17 48mm long with 0.55N.m torque, rated current of 1.5A running at 1.25A) at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QorkxMkFOio

UPDATE:
- 26/05/2017 - v2 update. Slightly reduced tension of the belt. Raised the parts that could interfere with set crews which sticks out from the drive gear. 
- 23/08/2017 - New stronger base plate.
- 20/09/2017 - Fixed the Bowden connector for 2.85 being too tight. Adjustable tension for the v3 base plates.

# Making and Material

## Making Tips

- The dimensions in the model are optimised for printing at 0.2mm layer height. Printing at other layer heights such as 0.24 or 0.15 would cause Z dimension inaccuracy. 
- Print the 48 teeth pulley at 0.1mm height with extremely slow outer wall speed (under 10mm/s). Use glossy material instead of matte.
- Retract at all times while printing the frames. Otherwise the filament will ooze during travel and cause under extrusion at perimeters. 
- Print top plate of frame at 100% infill. The compression spring apply massive force to the left side of top plate. Make sure it's rigid. 
- Rub the cylinder pin on hard surface such as file, concrete or stone to turn it into a D shaft
- If printing with high temperature filament such as ABS or PC, scale the model larger in X and Y direction in slicer to compensate for shrinkage. For reference, my experience with UP ABS works with 100.3% scale. 
- Refer to the image of formula of how to calculate esteps. 
- For Ultimaker 2, add a piece of 1mm silicon sheet between the motor and frame as damper. This will reduce the retraction noise of motor vibrating frame.
